# Comic-Center
## Graduate Course: Intermediate Statistical Modeling for Business
This was an individual project from a course on Cluster Analysis (an unsupervised machine learning technique for statistical modeling). Below is the prompt from the client:

>My name is Stuart Bloom and I run a hobby shop in Pasadena California called Comic Center; we generally sell comics, but we also sell other hobby items as well as some video games. Recently a chain hobby shop opened up in town, so I have been looking for ways to improve my business. My friend and regular customer Leonard suggested I try to collect data on my customers to better understand their spending habits. So, I added a survey to my receipts to learn more about my customers. 
>
>The survey asked customers:
1. “How many minutes did you spend in the store (approximately)?" (timeInStore),
2. “How old are you in years?" (age), and
3. “How Many times have you come to Comic Center in the last month?"(numVisits)
>
>From the receipt, I also recorded:
1. How much they spent in dollars in total (purchaseAmount)
2. How many Items they bought (numItems)
3. How much they spent on comic books in dollars (comicBookAmount)
?
>I am really interested in getting a better understanding of who my customers are; I know that many of my regulars are stereotypical "nerds" who are really into comic books, but I want to know more about the other customers I have. Currently my store primarily focuses on comic books, so it would be helpful to know how much different kinds of customers spend on comic books. The survey responses I have gotten so far are included in the data set I've attached; are you able to help me make sense of this data?
